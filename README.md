# Python Bokeh Plotting

Bokeh is an interactive visualization library in python. The goal of Bokeh is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics with the comfort of high level languages such as Python. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications without much of complexity and can use web browser for presentation. Finally we donâ€™t need to write any different languages like JavaScript, HTML or D3.js, but have the ability to plot similar graphs.
